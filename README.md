# Here, the following tasks are implemented:

## Task 1

Create a generalized functional interface. Write a class with one method. In this method, implement the logic:

* if the number 1 is entered into the console, then: use the interface with a string type and
  pass the logic of reversing the string (outputting the string in reverse order) to the interface method.


* if the number 2 is entered into the console, then: use the interface with an integer type and
  pass the logic of finding the factorial of a number to the interface method.

## Task 2 (optional)

Get the day of the week by date.
